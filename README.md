## About The Project

This project aims to provide transparency in AI's decision-making process. XeeAI allows users to interact with a chatbot and visualize how the AI interprets their input to generate a response. By offering insights into the inner workings of the AI, we hope to build user trust and promote a better understanding of artificial intelligence.
