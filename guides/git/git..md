# Basics

You might have heard of **Git** and **GitHub** and think they are the same. They are not.

**Git** is the language. **GitHub** is the platform. 

Now that the difference is clear, let's take a look what **git** really is.

`git` is a version control system that tracks versions of files.  Developers use `git` to collaborate and create a functioning software.  

> Learning `git` is essential for our thesis paper if we want to build our application, so please try your best to learn.

## Pre-git experience

Do you remember the time where you collaborated with your group in your programming subject as a freshman? I do.

Back then, we used to exchange code through either Google Drive or Messenger. It was really messy because the C++ files were constantly tossed around, so you can expect file names like `final.cpp`, `last_na_to.cpp`, or `final_na_talaga.cpp`. I even experienced the "it works on my device, bro" moment which was a nightmare. 

We couldn't make a cohesive, functioning program, because everybody wants to keep on adding feature after feature, and it had gotten to the point where those features were conflicted to one another.

# Why Git?
Whether you can relate yourself with my story or not ,  you should definitely learn `git`. `git` makes it easier to save different versions of your code. 

Say you added a new feature to your program, but what if you need the  feature from the previous version? Or your new version are full of bugs so you compare the code of the previous version to see where it went wrong?

`git` lets you seamlessly collaborate with other developers, and maintain the stability of your program. 

# Why GitHub?
GitHub is the platform where software engineers and developers share their code to each other through repositories. This is where you can contribute to an open-source project. 
# Now, start your path

You need hands-on experience when it comes to learning `git`. You can start by [installing git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) in your operating system.  You should learn some basic commands [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary#commands).

Next, do the following:
1. Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
2. Sign-up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) using your FEU Tech Email.
3. Create a repository, then copy the link
4. Make a folder in your computer, then clone the repository there 

You should start your learning `git` from there. If you are having trouble and needing resources, here it is:
